Note: Ceph and OpenStack are an extremely useful and
[highly popular](https://www.openstack.org/assets/survey/April2017SurveyReport.pdf)
combination. This is from the OpenStack User Survey from April 2017,
showing that Ceph RBD is the single most popular backend, by a large
margin, for Cinder storage. (The User Survey doesn’t come with any
such stats for Glance, or for Nova ephemeral storage.)
